            Since joining Gand Circus' software development program I have created multiple programs that can be found on GitHub.
            I am enjoy seeing the progress I have made throughout the program. 
            In the links provided you will find several completed projects during the last few months taking the after hour classes.

            Our Movie List project separates the available movies by category. Utiilizing the List element of coding.
            This returns the category and movie the user is searching for from the list provided.

            The Survival game has been one of my favorites. Coding set up similar to a game that a user would interact with.
            This application calculates survival rating based on Villager and Farmer survival ratings.
