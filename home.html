        <h3>Where I Am From, Where I Have Been, And Where I Want To Go</h3>
        <p>
        I was born and grew up in the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Detroit+Metropolitan+Area,+MI/@42.6740421,-84.3673809,8z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8824eb3ebbb50f79:0x2c296b784b3160f7!8m2!3d42.8105356!4d-83.0790865">Metro Detroit area</a>, spending most of my childhood in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Redford+Charter+Twp,+MI/@42.3990354,-83.3614465,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8824b5ac9d5302cd:0x702382035155fa91!8m2!3d42.3944486!4d-83.2973732">Redford</a>, MI. 
        I rented my first apartment in downtown Detroit from my late teens to early 20s.
        I moved into a condo unit at age 22 in downtown Dearborn where I fell in love with the community here.
        I purchased my first home in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dearborn+Heights,+MI/@42.3127481,-83.3353148,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x883b4a62412eaffd:0x70fd341efca3720!8m2!3d42.3369816!4d-83.2732627">Dearborn Heights</a> at 24 where I still live today, and love my little home more each day.
        </p>
        <p>
        I love to travel out west. Arizona, Nevada, and Colorado have been my favorite places to visit. 
        I plan to visit more of New Mexico and Oregon within the next few years. 
        It is my dream to find a home in Nevada or Arizona to settle into a place with no snow. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Before my life comes to end, I want to travel to New Zealand.
        I plan to spend as much time hiking and Whale Watching from every shore.

            <h3>My Development Journey</h3>
            <p>
                While I have worked in my current career for about 10 years, I have been searching for something more fulfilling. 
                I have been looking for a career where I can express my creativity and problem solve. 
                I discovered software development through my current employer and have been enthusiastic about it ever since.
                I am proud of the projects I have made using my new skills and am excited to see where these new skills take me.
