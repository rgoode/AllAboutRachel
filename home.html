        <h3>Where I Am From, Where I Have Been, And Where I Want To Go</h3>
        <p>
        I was born and grew up in the Metro Detroit area, spending most of my childhood in Redford, MI. 
        I rented my first apartment in downtown Detroit from my late teens to early 20s.
        I purchased a condo unit at 22 in downtown Dearborn where I fell in love with the community here.
        I purchased my first home in Dearborn Heights at 24 where I still live today, and love my little home more each day.
        Since purchasing my first home, I have purchased several others that I rent until I decide on my forever home.

        I love to travel out west. Arizona, Nevada, and Colorado have been my favorite places to visit. 
        I plan to visit more of New Mexico and Oregon within the next few years. 
        It is my dream to find a home in Nevada or Arizona to settle into a place with no snow.

        Before my life comes to end, I want to travel to New Zealand.
        I plan to spend as much time hiking and Whale Watching from every shore.

            <h3>My Development Journey</h3>
            <p>
                While I have worked in my current career for about 10 years, I have been searching for something more fulfilling. 
                I have been looking for a career where I can express my creativity and problem solve. 
                I discovered software development through my current employer and have been enthusiasic about it ever since.
                I am proud of the projects I have made using my new skills and am excited to see where these new skills take me.
